# Installation

## NPM

Vuneâ€™s only peer dependency is Vue 3. If you are working with Vue 2, this is not the package for you.

```bash
npm install vune

# or

yarn add vune
```

## Browser

Vune can be used in the browser alongside a browser version of Vue 3.

Use this script tag in your index.html

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vune@0.3.0/dist/vune.min.js" />
```
